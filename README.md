# Analyze-and-predict-stock-market-volatility

###
This study analyzes the correlation between the two stock markets using linear 
regression model to confirm the low correlation between the two stock markets using 
the data of KOSPI 200, a representative of the Korean stock market, and S&P 500, a 
representative of the U.S. stock market, and also analyzes the correlation between 
macroeconomic factors and the two stock markets using multiple linear regression 
model.The results show that consumer price index and gold price have the most 
significant impact on KOSPI 200, while SPY trading volume and consumer price index 
have the most significant impact on S&P 500.
Through the time series analysis, the volatility of the two stocks is close to the 
T-distribution and the volatility distribution does not exceed the outliers, so the 
SARIMAX model and LSTM model were used to predict the stock price, as both 
models have high coefficients of determination and good prediction effect.
